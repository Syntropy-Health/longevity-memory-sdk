"""The typed extractor boundary (addendum G21).

An extractor turns one check-in source into proposals. Every extractor — ``rules-v1`` text,
``fixture-sidecar-v1`` and any future model-backed one — returns :class:`Proposal` models, and the
service passes its output through :func:`validate_proposals` before anything reaches the journal.

Contract for a model-backed extractor (none exists in this build; no live model is called): ask the
model for structured output covering the ``Proposal`` fields except ``flags`` and ``blocking`` (the
model never sets them), build each item with ``Proposal.model_validate``, then run ``detect_flags``,
as both current extractors do. ``extra="forbid"`` refuses any field the schema lacks (a risk score,
an interpretation), so a model cannot widen what is shown.
